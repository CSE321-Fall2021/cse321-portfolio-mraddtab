About
=======
This repository contains the projects and coursework done by Ronald Chen in CSE321. This course studies realtime and embedded systems. The hardware used can be found here: https://ublearns.buffalo.edu/ultra/courses/_181342_1/cl/outline. This repository is to be kept private until the end of the Fall 2021 Semester.

Project 1: Documentation and Planning
======
This project focuses on the early stages of an engineering design. The early stages of designing a system requires asking important questions about the problem, researching and imagining possible solutions, and putting action into desigining a plan. My documentation showcases how to create a strong foundation when designing a solution, as well as proper commenting practices for code. 

Project 2: Prototyping and Implementation
=====
This project aims to create a user configurable timer by combining software and hardware. The hardware componeents include  a Nucleo-L4R5ZI, Solderless Breadboard, LCD display, LEDs, and a 4x4 keypad. The user will be able to input time, pause the timer, and  start the timer. When the timer has completed, four LEDs will light up. 

Project 3: Humidity Alarm
=====
This project aims to create a "Humidity Alarm", by once again combining software and hardware. The hardware componenets also include a Nucleo-LR45ZI, DHT11 sensor, buzzer,  16x2 LCD display, solderless breadboard, jumper wires, resistors, and a micro USB-A to micro USB-B cable. The DHT11 will monitor the humidity levels of the home, and display it on the LCD. When humidity levels reach a harmful level, the buzzer will sound until levels return to normal or the user manually mutes it.
